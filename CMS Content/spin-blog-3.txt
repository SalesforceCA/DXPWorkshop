Our community is such a supportive place, and we especially love the energy in the studio when loved ones show up to support each other. Seeing families and friends ride together and celebrate each other’s successes is so special.

Harper and Michael have been working out together for over a year now, and they never fail to impress us with their positivity and determination. We sat down with them to find out a little more about why they love riding together and how they’re able to coordinate their schedules to prioritize their shared work outs. We are so inspired by them, and we know that they’ll inspire you, too!
