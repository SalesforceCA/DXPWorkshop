<p>Race season is upon us! We’re so lucky in this city to have such a beautiful backdrop to our outdoor runs, but we believe that coming inside for a sweat once in a while holds tons of benefits. For those of you training for upcoming races, you should consider adding spin to your regimen! We know – we might be slightly biased in our love of spin . . . So, here are the cold hard facts on cross training!</p>
<br>
<p>Cross training is an exercise regimen that uses different modes of training in service of a particular type of fitness. If you’re training for a marathon, for example, the idea is that adding spin, yoga, weight-lifting, etcetera to your schedule will improve and support your running.</p>
<br>
<p>Cross training in general has tons of benefits. First, it reduces the likelihood of injury by spreading strain over various muscle groups and joints. Second, it keeps you mentally engaged; shaking up your routine is fun and keeps you committed longterm. Finally, it improves your total fitness by balancing strength training with aerobic conditioning with stretching and so on. You get to improve the entire package while working towards a specific goal.</p>
